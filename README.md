## <a name = "project1" />Project 1:

The project description is in [Project-1.pdf].

For ***part1***, you are required to construct seven Graph Searching Algorithms.

Unweighted Graph:

* [Breadth-First Search (BFS)]
* [Depth-First Search (DFS)]
* [Depth-Limited Search (DLS)]
* [Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)] 


Weighted Graph:

* [Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)] (or the Dijkstra Algorithm)
* [A Star Search (A*)]
* [Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)]

A useful slides can be found [here].

You can find the codes of algorithm in [search.py].



For ***part2***, you are required to implement the game [Clickomania] and apply Graph Searching Algorithms you had done in part1 to find the optimal solution(or trying to find).

You can find two ways to implement the game in [Game1] and [Game2] and two ways to implement the player in [Player1] and [Player2]

"project2"

In ***part1***, you are required to construct a [Bayesian network (BN)] and implement Structure Learning Parameter Learning and Inference

Functions need to implement:

* [K2 Algorithm]
* [Maximum_likelihood_estimation]
* [Variable elimination]
* K2 Score
* BIC Score

You can find the codes of algorithm in [structurelearning.py] and [variableelimination.py].

The project description is in [Project-3.pdf].

[Project-3.pdf]: https://github.com/ElvishElvis/Ve593-JI-SJTU-AI-technique/blob/master/Project%203/Project-3.pdf

You are required to construct an [Artificial_neural_network] and then use it to testify on the a famous handwritten character database, [Mnist].

Feasible features need to implement:

* [Activation_function]
* [Gradient_descent]
* [Backpropagation]
